# OOP-Problem-Solving
Welcome to my 'OOP-Problem-Solving' repository!
This is where I store and showcase my personal projects related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
As a self-learner and enthusiast, I've created these projects to apply and refine my understanding of OOP principles,
and this will also serve as a resources for beginner striving to learn OOP.

## Project 1: Bank Account
A basic console-based banking system implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
Key features include creating accounts, checking balances, and making deposits/withdrawals.

### Usage:
- Create bank accounts with unique numbers with pin for extra security.
- Check balances, deposit, withdraw funds, and transfer money.
- Basic input validation and user-friendly prompts included.
