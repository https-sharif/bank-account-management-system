# OOP-Problem-Solving
Welcome to "My OOP Projects" repository!
This is where I store and showcase my personal projects related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
As a self-learner and enthusiast, I've created these projects to apply and refine my understanding of OOP principles,
and I'm excited to share my journey with you.

### Project 1: Bank Account
A basic console-based banking system implemented in C++ for learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
Key features include creating accounts, checking balances, and making deposits/withdrawals.

Usage:

Create bank accounts with unique numbers.
Check balances, deposit, and withdraw funds.
Basic input validation and user-friendly prompts included.
